\chapter{Spectrum sensing}

Spectrum sensing is the very task upon which the entire operation of cognitive
radio rests. Spectrum sensing is defined as the finding of spectrum holes in 
the local neighborhood of the cognitive radio receiver. Spectrum holes are the
underutilized (in part or in full) subbands of spectrum at a particular time
in a specific location. Moreover for cognitive radio to fulfil the potential
it offers in solving the problem of spectrum underutilization, the spectrum 
sensor or the spectrum sensing method should be reliable and computationally
feasible in real-time \cite{haykin09}.
