\chapter{OpenBTS}

OpenBTS is a Unix application that uses a software radio to present a GSM Um interface 
to handsets and uses a SIP softswitch or PBX to connect calls.
The combination of the global-standard GSM air interface with low cost VoIP backhaul 
forms the basis of a new type of cellular network that can be deployed and operated at a much lower
cost than existing technologies in many applications, 
especially rural cellular deployments and private cellular networks in remote areas.

\section{The OpenBTS Application Suite}
A complete OpenBTS installation consists of many distinct applications:

\begin{description}
\item[OpenBTS] The actual OpenBTS application, containing most of the GSM stack above the radio modem.
\item[Transceiver] The software radio modem and hardware control interface.
\item[Smqueue] A store-and-forward server for text messaging.
\item[Asterisk] A VoIP PBX or ``softswitch''.
\item[SIPAuthServe] An application managing the database of subscriber information.
\item[Other Services] Optional services supported through external servers, interfaced to OpenBTS through
various protocols.
\end{description}


\subsection{OpenBTS}
The OpenBTS application contains:
\begin{itemize}
\item L1 TDM functions (GSM 05.02)
\item L1 FEC functions (GSM 05.03)
\item L1 closed loop power and timing controls (GSM 05.08 and 05.10)
\item L2 LAPDm (GSM 04.06)
\item L3 radio resource management functions (GSM 04.08)
\item L3 GSM-SIP gateway for mobility management
\item L3 GSM-SIP gateway for call control
\item L4 GSM-SIP gateway for text messaging
\end{itemize}

The general design approach of OpenBTS is not to implement any function above L3 or L4, so at L3 or L4
every subprotocol of GSM is either terminated locally or translated through a gateway to some other protocol
for handling by an external application. Similarly, OpenBTS itself does not contain any speech transcoding
functions above the L1 FEC parts.


\subsection{Transceiver}
The transceiver application performs the radiomodem functions of GSM 05.05 and manages 
the Gigabit Ethernet interface
(USB2 interface, in case
of USRP1 or older models) to the radio hardware.

\subsection{Smqueue}
Smqueue is an RFC-3428 store-and-forward server that is used for 
text messaging in the OpenBTS system. Smqueue is required to send 
a text message from one MS to another, or to provide reliable 
delivery of text messages to an MS from any source.

\subsection{Asterisk}
OpenBTS uses a SIP router or PBX to perform the 
call control functions that are normally performed by the MSC
in a conventional GSM network, although in 
most network configurations this switching
function is distributed over multiple switches. 
These switches also provide transcoding services.

\subsection{SIPAuthServe}
An application that implements Subscriber Registry, the database of subscriber 
information that replaces both
the Asterisk SIP registry and the GSM Home Location Register (HLR) 
found in a conventional GSM net-
work.
