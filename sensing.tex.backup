\chapter{Spectrum sensing}

Spectrum sensing is the main task in the entire operation of cognitive
radio. Spectrum sensing is defined as the finding of spectrum holes in 
the local neighborhood of the cognitive radio receiver. Spectrum holes are the
underutilized (in part or in full) subbands of spectrum at a particular time
in a specific location. Moreover for cognitive radio to fulfil its potential
in solving the problem of spectrum underutilization, the spectrum sensing 
method used should be reliable and computationally feasible in real-time 
\cite{haykin09}.

There are many spectrum sensing techniques available. Three important ones of
them are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Energy detection
    \item Matched filter detection
    \item Cyclostationarity detection
\end{itemize}

\section{Energy detection}

Conventional energy detector is made up of a low pass filter, an A/D converter
, a square law detector and an integrator. This implementation is not flexible
enough, especially in the case of narrowband signals and sinewaves.

So, an alternative implementation using Average Periodogram method is usually
used. In this case, we find the squared magnitude of the FFT. we can alter the
bandwidth scanned just by taking the required number of FFT bins.
