\chapter{Implementation of a cognitive Base Transceiver Station in GSM band using OpenBTS and spectrum sensing techniques}
In this project we try to demonstrate a more efficient 
way of utilizing the spectral resources by having the secondary users
make use of the spectrum holes. The spectrum holes are the frequency channels
that have been licensed to the primary users but are not being used at that
particular space and time. This allows secondary users to make use of already 
licensed frequency bands instead of having to allot them completely new 
frequency bands altogether.
