\chapter*{\centering{Abstract}}
The explosive proliferation of mobile phones and other wireless communication
devices has rendered the spectrum an insufficient resource. To make things
worse, there exists a widespread underutilization of the spectrum. Cognitive
Radio (CR) offers to tackle this problem by finding the unused frequency bands
in the spectrum (also known as spectrum holes) and allocating them to the
secondary users for use. Hence, CR makes the usage of spectrum more efficient.

We demonstrate the capabilities of CR by developing a Two-frequency CR testbed
and a Four-frequency CR testbed. Secondary users switch to an unused frequency
band as soon as the presence of primary users is detected in the frequency
band of operation. Energy detection method is used for the spectrum sensing.
