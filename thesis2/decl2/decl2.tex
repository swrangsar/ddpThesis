\chapter*{\centering{Declaration of Academic Ethics}}
\thispagestyle{empty}

I declare that this written submission represents my ideas in my own words
and where others' ideas or words have been included, I have adequately cited
and referenced the original sources. I also declare that I have adhered to all
principles of academic honesty and integrity and have not misrepresented or
fabricated or falsified any idea/data/fact/source in my submission. I
understand that any violation of the above will be cause for disciplinary
action by the Institute and can also evoke penal action from the sources which
have thus not been properly cited or from whom proper permission has not been
taken when needed.
