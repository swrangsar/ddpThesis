\chapter*{\centering{Abstract}}
Our goal is to set up a software defined cognitive radio using OpenBTS, GNU Radio and USRP kits. 
We decide on a frequency channel, to run our cognitive OpenBTS system in, beforehand. 
First we sense the presence of ongoing calls made by the primary users in the predefined frequency channel. 
The sensing is done by calculating the energy in that channel using a technique of energy detection called peroidogram analysis.
If the energy is above some predefined threshold then there are ongoing calls in that channel and hence 
we wait for the calls to end. 
As soon as the calls involving the primary users end the energy in that channel goes low.
GNU Radio detects this change and it provides the ARFCN, corresponding to this channel, 
to the secondary BTS system and the secondary BTS starts using this ARFCN allowing 
secondary users to make calls and send SMSs.
