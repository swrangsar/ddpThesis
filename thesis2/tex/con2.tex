\chapter{Conclusion}

Cognitive radio is the solution to current day problem of inefficient 
utilization of the radio spectrum. It identifies the spectrum holes and 
enables secondary users to utilize these holes for communication thereby 
increasing total number of mobile users. We have demonstrated these cognitive
radio capabilities using a two frequency and a four frequency cognitive radio
test bed and successfully testing them.  We demonstrated that the secondary 
users quit the frequency channel which they are utilizing for communication
as soon as the corresponding primary radio emerges thereby giving higher
priority to the primary users.
