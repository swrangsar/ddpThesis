\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Background}
The electromagnetic radio spectrum is a natural resource that remains 
underutilized \cite{haykin05}.
It is licensed by governments for use by transmitters and receivers.
With the explosive proliferation of cell phones and other wireless 
communication devices,
we cannot afford to be lavish in using our spectral resources anymore.

In November 2002, the Spectrum Policy Task Force, a group under \gls{fcc}
 in the United States, published a report saying
\cite{repFCC}, 
\begin{quote}
``In many bands, spectrum access is a more significant problem than physical 
scarcity of spectrum, in large part due to legacy command-and-control 
regulation that limits the ability of potential spectrum users to obtain such 
access.''
\end{quote}

If we were to scan the radio spectrum even in metropolitan places where it's
heavily used, 
we would find that \cite{staple04}:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item some frequency bands are unoccupied most of the time,
	\item some are only partially occupied and
	\item the rest are heavily used.
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

The underutilization of spectral resources leads us to think in terms of 
\emph{spectrum holes}, which are defined as \cite{kolodzy01}:
\begin{quote}
\emph{A spectrum hole is a band of frequencies assigned to a \gls{pu}, 
but, at a particular time and specific geographic location, the band is not 
being utilized by that user.
}
\end{quote}

The spectrum can be better utilized by enabling \glspl{su} (users who are
not licensed to use the services) to access spectrum holes unoccupied by 
\glspl{pu} at the location and the time in question. 
\emph{Cognitive Radio}, which includes software-defined radio, has been 
promoted as the means to make efficient use of the spectrum by exploiting the 
existence of spectrum holes \cite{haykin05}\cite{mitola99}\cite{mitola00}.

\section{Cognitive Radio}
One of the definitions of Cognitive Radio is \cite{haykin05}:
\begin{quote}
\emph{Cognitive radio is an intelligent wireless communication system that is
aware of its surrounding environment (i.e., outside world), and uses the 
methodology of understanding-by-building to learn from the environment and 
adapt its internal states to statistical variations in the incoming \gls{rf} stimuli
by making corresponding changes in certain operating parameters (e.g., 
transmit-power, carrier-frequency, and modulation strategy) in real-time, with
two primary objectives in mind:
\begin{itemize}
	\item highly reliable communications whenever and wherever needed;
	\item efficient utilization of the radio spectrum.
\end{itemize}}
\end{quote}

Besides, a cognitive radio is also reconfigurable. This property of cognitive 
radio is provided by a platform known as \emph{software-defined radio}. 
\gls{sdr} is basically a combination of two key 
technologies: digital radio, and computer software.

\section{Contribution of this Thesis}

A cognitive radio system is developed to demonstrate the efficient 
utilization of spectrum by allowing \glspl{su} to make use of the 
frequency bands that are already licensed to \glspl{pu} but that are not 
being used at that particular time and space.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A 2-frequency system is developed where as soon as the presence of 
    \glspl{pu} is detected in $F_1$  the secondary system switches from $F_1$ 
    to $F_2$ and vice-versa.
    \item The 2-frequency system is extended to a 4-frequency one where
    two of the four frequency channels always remain occupied. The secondary
    system switches to one of the two unused frequency channels.
    \item For sensing the frequency channels the energy detection based
    spectrum sensing method has been used and for peak detection the method 
    called CUSUM has been used. The frequency used by the \glspl{su} is
    sensed continuously and as soon as the presence of \glspl{pu} in that 
    frequency is detected the secondary leaves that frequency and switches to
    an underutilized frequency in the neighborhood.
\end{enumerate}



\section{Organization of this Thesis}
The remaining chapters of this document are organized as follows. Chapter 2 
briefly touches upon the \gls{gsm} system architecture and the \gls{gsm} protocol 
architecture. Chapter 3 introduces \gls{sdr} and some of the
tools that make \gls{sdr} possible such as the\gls{usrp} N210
and the GNURadio software package. Various parts of the OpenBTS 
software are described in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 reviews various techniques of 
spectrum sensing and gives a comparison among them. Chapter 6 describes the 
\gls{cr} Test-Bed that we have developed using OpenBTS. Flowgraphs of
the algorithms developed while making the \gls{cr} Test-Bed are also given in
Chapter 6. Finally, Chapter 7 concludes this document.
