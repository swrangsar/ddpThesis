\chapter{Conclusion}

The rapid growth in the number of cell phones and other wireless devices has 
brought about a scarcity of spectral resources. This is further worsened by the
inefficient usage of the spectrum. Cognitive Radio offers to solve this problem
by finding the spectrum holes and enabling secondary users to utilize them. CR 
thereby increases the number of mobile device users possible. We have 
demonstrated the capabilities of CR by developing a 2-frequency CR Test-Bed and
a 4-frequency CR Test-Bed and successfully testing them out.  We have shown
that the secondary users yield the frequency channel they have been utilizing
for communication as soon as the presence of primary users is detected thus
giving a higher priority to the primary users.
