\section{Conclusion}
The rapid growth in the number of cell phones and other wireless devices has 
brought about a scarcity of spectral resources. This is further worsened by the
inefficient usage of the spectrum. Cognitive Radio has a lot of potential to solve this problem
by finding the spectrum holes and enabling secondary users to utilize them. CR 
thereby increases the number of mobile device users possible by putting 
underutilized frequency bands into use. We have 
demonstrated the capabilities of CR by developing a 2-frequency CR Test-Bed and
a 4-frequency CR Test-Bed and successfully testing them out.  We have shown
that the secondary users yield the frequency channel they have been utilizing
for communication as soon as the presence of primary users is detected thus
giving a higher priority to the primary users.


\section{Future work}
To detect the presence of active primary users, we have used energy detection 
based spectrum sensing method to measure the energy level at the uplink 
frequency of the primary BTS. This energy level is dependent
on the distance of the primary users from the sensing unit. Thus, our criteria
for determining the presence of primary users is distance dependent. 
In future, this dependency could be removed by resorting to better 
spectrum sensing techniques.

When our secondary system switches to a new underutilized frequency band, the
secondary calls get dropped and have to be restarted. Better
algorithms could be designed to avoid this call drop from happening.
