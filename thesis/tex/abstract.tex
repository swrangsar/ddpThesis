\chapter*{\centering{Abstract}}
The explosive proliferation of mobile phones and other wireless communication
devices has rendered the spectrum an insufficient resource. To make things
worse, there exists a widespread underutilization of the spectrum. \gls{cr}
offers to tackle this problem by finding the unused frequency bands
in the spectrum (also known as spectrum holes) and allocating them to the
\glspl{su} for use. Hence, \gls{cr} makes the usage of spectrum more
efficient.

We demonstrate the capabilities of \gls{cr} by developing a 2-frequency \gls{cr} Test-Bed
and a 4-frequency \gls{cr} Test-Bed. \glspl{pu} and \glspl{su} are made to
coexist in the same frequency band. Energy detection method is used for the
spectrum sensing. \glspl{pu} switch from their frequency band of operation to an
unused frequency band as soon as the activity of \glspl{pu} is detected.
