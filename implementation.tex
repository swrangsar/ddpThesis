\chapter{Implementation of a cognitive Base Transceiver Station in GSM band using OpenBTS and spectrum sensing techniques}
In this project we try to demonstrate a more efficient 
way of utilizing the spectral resources by having the secondary users
make use of the spectrum holes. The spectrum holes are the frequency channels
that have been licensed to the primary users but are not being used at that
particular space and time. This allows secondary users to make use of already 
licensed frequency bands instead of having to allot them completely new 
frequency bands altogether.

In the first phase of the project, we implemented a two-frequency system where
the secondary system had an option of switching into one of two frequency 
channels depending on which one was free. We expanded this to a four-frequency
system with two primary systems in the second phase. The secondary would 
search for an unused frequency band among these four frequencies, two of which
always remain used.
