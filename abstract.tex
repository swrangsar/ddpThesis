\chapter*{\centering{Abstract}}
The explosive proliferation of mobile phones and other wireless communication
devices has rendered the spectrum an insufficient resource. This situation is
made worse by the widespread underutilization of the spectrum. Cognitive Radio (CR)
offers to tackle this problem by finding the spectrum holes and allowing them
to be used by the secondary users. Hence, CR increases the efficiency of
spectrum usage.

We demonstrate the aforementioned capabilities of CR by developing a
Two-frequency CR testbed and a Four-frequency CR testbed. Secondary users
switch their frequency of operation to an unused frequency band as soon as the
presence of primary users is detected in that particular frequency band.
Energy detection method is used for the spectrum sensing.
